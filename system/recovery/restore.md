#  Restore

### Steps
1. copy backup to your server (if needed)

        scp /{YourLocalBackupPath} {userErp}@6{serverIp}:/home/{userErp}/{benchDiirName}


2. SSH to your server, and login as non root account and make sure frappe applications & services stopped

    su - {erpUser}


3. Check your site `site_config.json` first. You have to make sure that the `site_config.json` on the server is equal to your downloaded `site_config.json` back up file. Otherwise, replace your `site_config.json` on the server with your downloaded `site_config.json`. (skip this step if your downloaded and the file on your server is equal)

    first: replace your `site_config.json` file

        nano /home/{erpUser}/{BenchDirName}/sites/{sitesName}/site_config.json

    * and then copy paste with your downloaded `site_config.json` file
    * use `ctrl` + `shift` + `6` and select your cursor to end document, hit `ctrl` + `k` to cut the text, and then open then copy your downloaded files, and paste to your nano editor. Hit `ctrl` + `x`, type `y`, hit `enter` twice

    second: fix the database
    open your mysql terminal

        mysql -u root -p  
        Enter password: YOURPASSWORD  
        show databases;

    open your `site_config.json` and you can find key called `db_name`. make sure that the value of `db_name` is available on your table list. If not. create the new one

        create database {db_name};

    or better if database allready exist, you can recreate that one.

        drop database {db_name};
        create database {db_name};


    next step is check your mysql username. the user used in sites is the database name itself. Type following code and if  you cant find `db_name` as user listed on table, please continue to next step. 

        use mysql;  
        SELECT user FROM user;  


    create new user in mysql according to user listed on your downloaded `site_config.json` file. Follow this step. (you need to read `db_name` and `db_password` key from your downloaded `site_config.json` file.

        CREATE USER '{db_name}'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '{db_password}';

    grant access to your newly added user (if user allready exist, skip this step)

        GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO '{db_name}'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;


    exit your mysql terminal and restar mysql service

        exit; // on the sql terminal
        sudo service mysqld restart // on ssh terminal


4. Run restore script. make sure erp services are turned off

        sudo service nginx stop
        sudo service supervisor stop
    
        bench --site {sitename} --force restore {path to database backup file .sql} --with-private-files {relative-path-to-private-files-backup-file .tar} --with-public-files {relative-path-to-public-files-backup-file .tar}

    just in case you don't back up the private and public files

        bench --site {sitename} --force restore {path to database backup file .sql}

5. Once process done, try to run your frappe application again

        sudo service mysqld restart
        sudo service nginx start
        sudo service supervisor start

6. If you had any errors after restore

    * unable boot
    ![alt text](../assets/restoreError.jpeg "Title")

    this problem usually occur when erpnext is updated to newer versions. Try to run `bench migrate` script

    run bench migrate

         bench --site {site} migrate

    re-run services

        sudo service mysqld restart
        sudo supervisorctl restart all

    if the error persists, please check error logs here 

        cd /home/{erpUser}/{BenchDirName}/sites/{sitesName}/error_snapshots
